# README #

This is a project that I created to attempt some solutions for the questions in LeetCode site.
At the beginning, most of my solutions are coded in Java, though nowadays more and more are implemented in Python.

### Organization ###

* A source file corresponds to a single question, which can contain several solutions.

* In some cases, I aggregated several solutions into a single file to several questions that share the same context or spirit.
